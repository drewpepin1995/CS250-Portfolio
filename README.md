- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is an application that helps student drivers prep for the driving test, by managing driving lessons, communcating with instructors, and getting updates from the DMV. The client is a company called DriverPass. They want a system that gives users an easier experience prepping for the driving test. 
- What did you do particularly well?
When designing all the diagrams needed, I believe I did a good job outlining the application and what is needed, and how all the users will interact. 
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I believe I could have added more classes to my UML class diagram. 
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Properly integrating the user needs into your application is the most crucial part of building an application. If you want a successful launch and to maintain success, you need to build around what the user wants. I implemented everything the user requested into my diagrams. 
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
My strategy is always breaking the overarching problem into smaller, more concise tasks. I believe it makes the bigger project more manageable when you have smaller pieces to approach vs one large problem.
